Repository of examples using DANDI archive datasets authored as MATLAB® live scripts

## About 
The **[DANDI Archive](https://dandiarchive.org/)** hosts and catalogues openly licensed cellular neurophysiology datasets which allows for reproduced and reworked analyses, which can in turn strenghthen and advance the quality and impact of those datasets.

This repository contains examples of reproduced and/or reworked DANDI archive dataset analyses authored as **MATLAB [live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/what-is-a-live-script-or-function.html)**. 

Broadly speaking, the examples contained here: 
* explain the scientific context of the study producing the original DANDI archive dataset
* illustrate how to access & use a DANDI archive dataset
* achieve a reproduction and/or reworking of one or more findings (e.g., specific figures) from a DANDI archive dataset, potentially generating novel insights

To achieve these goals, these live script examples combine code, narrative text, images, and sometimes [interactive controls](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/add-interactive-controls-to-a-live-script.html).

DANDI Archive datasets predominantly use the **[Neurodata without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) data standard** which allows neuroscientists to exchange cellular neurophysiology data in a common format. To access the dataset, most examples use *[MatNWB](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/67741-neurodatawithoutborders-matnwb)** which is an open-source MATLAB toolbox for inspecting, reading, writing, and working with data encoded in NWB format.
